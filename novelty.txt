The primary novelty feature, Personalized Guided Meditation Scripts, will utilize the Gemini model to dynamically generate custom meditation and breathing exercise scripts tailored precisely to the user's input context, such as their specific stress source (e.g., academic anxiety, relationship conflict) or their tracked mood/sleep data. This goes beyond generic advice by producing unique, actionable content that is saved directly within the application, offering immediate mental health utility under the "Stress Management" section. This implementation focuses heavily on advanced prompt engineering and structured output to ensure the script is not only creative but also therapeutically sound, addressing the user's specific holistic wellness needs identified by Carely's health profile assessment.
To maximize the project's uniqueness and deliver a superior user experience, this generative text output will be seamlessly extended using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) integration. The backend Node.js server will receive the generated meditation script and immediately pass it to a high-quality TTS API (like Google Cloud TTS or a similar service) to convert the text into a natural-sounding audio file (e.g., MP3 or WAV). The frontend will then display a simple audio player instead of the text, transforming the feature from a reading activity into a genuine AI-Guided Audio Wellness experience, thereby achieving a highly-scored multi-format generative output. This combination is a powerful differentiator, demonstrating sophisticated architecture that connects an LLM's generative capacity with external media creation tools.
