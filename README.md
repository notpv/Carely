I have successfully set up the backend for your project.

Here's a summary of the changes made:
- Created a `backend` directory.
- Added `package.json` with `express`, `cors`, and `body-parser` dependencies, and a `start` script.
- Created `server.js` with a basic Express server listening on port 3000.
- Installed all necessary dependencies for the backend.

To run the application, please follow these steps from your project's root directory:

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will start running (typically on `http://localhost:3000`).

2.  **Launch the frontend:**
    Open a **separate terminal** and run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

Both the backend and frontend must be running simultaneously for the app to function properly.
